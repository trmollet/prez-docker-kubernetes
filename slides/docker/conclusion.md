## Conclusion

Containerization makes CI/CD seamless, for example:
- applications have no system dependencies
- updates can be pushed to any part of a distributed application
- resource density can be optimized.

With Docker, scaling your application is a matter of spinning up new executables, not running heavy VM hosts.
