        CONTAINERS
        Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same
        machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less
        space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), and start almost instantly.

        VIRTUAL MACHINES
        Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple
        VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, one or more apps, necessary binaries and
        libraries - taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.
