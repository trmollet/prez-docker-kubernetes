## Docker Concept
*Containers* are:

- Flexible : Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- Lightweight : Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
- Interchangeable : You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
- Portable : You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
- Scalable : You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.

Note:
Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.
